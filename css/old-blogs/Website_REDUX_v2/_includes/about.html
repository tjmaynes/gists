<p><span style="font-size:2.0em;">M</span>y name is TJ Maynes and I enjoy programming in ruby and working on feature films. 
I've been working on computers since the age of 8, specifically interested in building my first website. 
I remember working on my website and showing it to friends using a floppy disk to store the data on. <span style="font-style:italic;">There wasn't any CSS or javascript 
on the site when I was that young, but there was a passion for learning more about computers.</span> This site is hosted through 
<a href="http://www.github.com/tjmaynes">GitHub</a> pages, which uses git and runs on Jekyll.

<p>I began my journey in photography when I began high school. Since then I have
worked closely with various high school journalism organizations (<a href="http://www.atpi.org/">ATPI</a> and <a href="http://www.sipa.sc.edu/">SIPA</a>)
in judging student contests as well as teaching from time to time. When I moved back to Florida in the summer of 2012. I saw a post on Craigslist for a 
"Camera Department Intern" that was needed. I ended up working as a grip on my first feature film, which you can read about in detail 
<a href="http://www.tjmaynes.com/blog/personal/Chu-And-Blossom">here</a>. Here is a link to my <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5299167">IMDB</a> profile.

<p>I'm continuing to learn as much as I can about the filmmaking process (whether in pre-production, production, or post-production) so that one day I can direct my own feature. 
A good bit of my time is spent finishing up my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I spend my free time learning <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a>, writing screenplays, 
traveling, and being around the family. Feel free to read my <a href="/archive">blog</a> or check out my life in  <a href="http://www.tjmaynes.tumblr.com/">pictures</a>.
Thank you for reading my bio, I really appreciate it!
