Its been quite a long time since I've updated my blog with a new post. So here it goes, I've been extremely focused on school and family as of this last year. I have about one more year left of school and am looking forward to graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of South Florida. I've been programming practically every day, where I've gained a lot of interest in learning mobile development. My current developer setup: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TJMaynes/config/master/.emacs">Emacs</a>, iTerm (w/<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TJMaynes/config/master/.zshrc">zsh</a>), and Firefox. I also enjoy listening to music on Soundcloud.

Things I'm learning/doing over the next few months:
<ul>
<li>Python (web development, basic scripting, and more).</li>
<li>iOS development (have an app in the app store by the end of Summer).</li>
<li>Spend more time exercising.</li>
<li>Ace my Summer classes!</li>
</ul>
