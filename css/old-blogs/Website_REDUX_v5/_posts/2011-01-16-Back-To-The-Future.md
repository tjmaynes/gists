When I was a child there was that one movie that started it all for me. A very cliche saying, yes-in-de-dee, however Back to the Future changed my whole life (at the age of 3). I learned at a young age to turn on the TV, rewind and fast-forward the VCR, and watched endless Bugs Bunny episodes early in the morning just from watching BTTF. Because of Back to the Future, my imagination expanded wildly when I was young. The movie affected the way I would look at life forever. I loved science and math, as well as contemplating how to create a time traveling Delorean because of BTTF. I used to put together random things together on those "Little Tykes" (was not battery operated) and called it my time machine. I'd pretend I was flying around in the Delorean, going 88 miles per hour, and traveling through timeâ€¦using my imagination. I mean how badass was that Dolorean? Still my favorite car from cinema. Little known fact: I started skateboarding because of this movie.
