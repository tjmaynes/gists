A note to the reader, "such segments of this story may require a bit of music to enhance the full 
experience of what life may come from this story. So I have written a song or two to listen to while
a certain segment, I hope this massages the inner imagination within you."

"When I was a child, elementary school perhaps, I spent a lot of my time at night thinking. 
I would think for hours on end, trying to figure out what makes the world go round. What causes
someone to commit an act of hatred or violence? Why are we still at war with each other? Why 
are we so chained to the value of a dollar and not to a life? These are all questions,
and many others, that would keep my young brain awake for many nights until I was so exhausted
from all the thinking I would finally fall right to sleep. I still do this from time to time,
not nearly as often as I once did in my youth, but after much knowledge from experience and
academia I have figured out the answers to many of my childhood questions. However, like a fool
I believed these answers were the truth. There is much to learn from even in my young adult-life
that I have left (I will be twenty soon enough), that the world does not operate like clockwork
and time is cold and ruthless. As controversial as it may seem, it is a miracle that such occurrences
as the existance of life have came to be."

Existance

*Written by TJ Maynes*

Segment One - "The Fire"

(Recommended: "il Forte" - Ennio Morricone)

The bright moon light shines into the cloudy desert sky. Mystified by the unknown, as much fearful of
what may come about of such dark shadows that lay within. Courage is the difference between what a beast
does and does not do to survive. The young ape-man follows his father through the path of moonlight and
out of the caves. A chill from the cool air spikes the young ape-man and his father. With the only thought
of hot bloody flesh in mind, the young ape-man follows the collector out of the caves and into the canyons.
Water falls from the sky, the young ape-man knows better than to go out in such unorthodox conditions.
Thunder breaks in the distance, frightened and panicked, the young ape-man leaps for safety. Father grabs
young ape-man in the pinnacle of stress as there is nothing to be afraid of. The young ape-man finds his ground.
Soaked and wallowing through thick crevasses of mud, the ape-men move forward. Behind a rock wall and two boulders
lurked a bear in search of warmth and food. The long days of dry season has killed many of the bears in the valley,
this one was nearly the last one of its pack. The smell successfully reaches the bear's abused nose.Teeth are in
such a violent flurry from the meat men that lay ahead. So close are they to the bear, that any second now the
bear would charge at the bigger one and later take out the younger. The bear knows better than to jump out 
in the open in a rush of energy. Many years of patience has taught him this. Patience and the smell rush through
the bear's nostrils and the drool drips from his overworked jaw down to the rocks. Eyes are locked on to the walking
meat and ready to attack as the young ape-man and father pace around a corner. Crawling up the rock wall, the bear
preps along the rock wall. The young ape-man feels strange going down this particular canyon path, this isn't right.
The father stops suddenly, all is silent for that moment. The beating muscle from inside of both ape's stomachs
are in a tour de force. Both are sharing the common notion that there is something to fear of what may lurk in front
of them. The bear's teeth are in a constant fit of violent flurry. The ape-men begin to fall back, when a lightning
strike reveals the fear they felt. The bear's blood-shot eyes frighten the ape-men and turn down the dark ally way.
Fits of anger and defeat ruffle around their cries as they scratch the surface of the rock walls around them. Nothing
to climb on, they are trapped. The bear charges after the young ape-man first and in the matter of split-seconds, the
father is in harms way of the bear's teeth. The bear grips the father's shoulder with its sharp teeth as the young ape-man
runs his escape. Watching his father be eaten alive by a blood thirsty bear saw fire in the eyes of the young ape-man.
The father gave his life for his son, the bear may have had a warm dinner that last only for a matter of a day or
maybe hours. What that bear does not know is that his latest dinner would most likely lead to his immediate death
by various spears and sharp rocks. For when one is striked down upon and survives, the rest of the pack will know.
Unionizing and gathering supplies the next night would be the bear's last. The fire in the young ape-man's eyes
were vibrant and glowing with a fit of rage. The young ape-man follows the moonlight back unfearful of anything
that may cross his way home.

Segment Two - "Empire State of Mind"

(Recommended: "Viva La Vida" - Cold Play)
