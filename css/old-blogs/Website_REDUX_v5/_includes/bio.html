<p>TJ is a Computer Science student at the University of South Florida. Loves to learn new things at lightening fast speeds. Considers himself to be a movie-buff that happens to also work on movies (as much as he can). A good bit of his free time is spent writing code, traveling, and being around the family.</p>
