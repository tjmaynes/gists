Lately, I haven't had very much time to write blog posts and work on the projects that I want to work on. Instead Analysis of Algorithms and undergraduate research has taken a significant portion of my time. However, I did start writing my papers in LaTeX which has actually been a fun experience and pretty easy to learn (and you get pretty reports)! Also, I've started to gain in interest in Video Streaming development from the undergradute research project that I am working on. My time management has been out of wack lately too, need to fix this problem. My algorithms class has been kicking my butt, however I'm enjoying the material I am learning - especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> (very interesting concept). You can find the algorithm projects that I have been working on <a href="http://github.com/TJMaynes/algorithms">here</a>.
